== What I learned

. Straightforward. :-)

== Approach

. I parse the file and put the command as a string and the value as an int in a list of tuples.
. For both stars, you go through the list and do what the instructions say to do.
. Star 2 is then not any more complicated than star 1, just different instructions.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
