== Day 02: Dive ==

This is my implementation for the second round of the dive puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where all helper functions that
might be re-used later on reside.
There is also a `vec.go`, which contains specifications and manipulation
for the submarine's movement and positioning.

There are currently no tests.
I will add them as needed to simplify debugging for more complex puzzles.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution.
