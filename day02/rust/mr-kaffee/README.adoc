== Day 02: Dive! ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2[AoC|2021|02].

=== Part 1 ===

The most difficult part today was to parse the input. My rust knowledge obviously is slightly rusty...
Eventually I created an enum with a `parse` function as follows:
[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=command]
----


The solution then is done with a simple fold operation on an iterator accumulating depth (y) and horizontal position (x)

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=calc_position]
----

=== Part 2 ===

The second part was an easy extension to the first part. Just add a third accumulator state for the aim (small trap: my horizontal position is called 'x' which is not the same as the 'X' in the puzzle description)

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=calc_position_with_aim]
----

=== Today I learned ===

Parsing simple inputs does not require regular expressions & creating enums with parse functions leads to a bit more code but looks much prettier
