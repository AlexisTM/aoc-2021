== Day 02: Dive! ==

https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2[AoC|2021|02].

=== Part 1 ===

Generic function to calculate the position.
Takes the input string, an initial value and a hash of lambdas updating the position

The function iterates through the lines of the ``input``. Each ``line`` is split in the command part ``cmd`` and the value part ``v`` (single space as separator). The command is used to select a lambda from the ``steps`` hash which is then called with the accumulator ``acc`` and the value ``v`` to udpate the accumulator.

include::solution.rb[tags=calc_position]

For part 1, this function is called as follows:

[source,ruby,numbered]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=calc_position_1]
----

=== Part 2 === 

For part 2, the aim has to be considered as additional value and the update rules are changed:

[source,ruby,numbered]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=calc_position_2]
----

=== Tests ===

[source,ruby,numbered]
----
include::solution_test.rb[tags=test_class]
----

=== Today I learned ===

+...+ that I don't know how to set up VS Code for decent Ruby development :(
