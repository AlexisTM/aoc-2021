=== Second Star

How does it work: +

Just to increase days did not work, so I had to find a different solution. Finaly I went with a map, see _fun laternfish2()_. The keys are the reproducing days 0-8, the values the number of fishes. Every day this map is updated. At the end the sum over all values is calculated.
