== AoC21-06: Lanternfish
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6

=== Info

Calculate exp. growth of lanternfish
*: After 80 days
**: After 256 days

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line (one line today...) and prepocessed.
Being wary of the mentioned exp. growth, I choose a list with bins for every counter state, i.e. 10 fish with timer "3" --> list[3] = 10.
Then one iteration was just to manage bin "0" (1x to "9", 1x added to "7") and shift afterwards all bins >1 down one bin.
Glad I did for star 2 ðŸ˜…

=== Learned today

Exp. growth does not always have to be scary.
