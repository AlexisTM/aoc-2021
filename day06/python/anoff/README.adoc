== Day 6: Lanternfish

Ahh Eric Wastel, you did it again!

=== TIL

. stop trying to understand weird growth patterns
. use proper data structures

=== First Star

Went the naive way and just kept increasing a list of fish days.

=== Second Star

Even without running my code I realized it will not produce an answer in a reasonable amount of time.
Of course I still ran it anyway..

While it kept running I thought about how to approach this problem.

Attempt 1: Try to find repeating patterns in the growth of the fish. Failed.

Attempt 2: Rethink data structures... d'OH, easy fix.
