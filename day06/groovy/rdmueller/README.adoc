== Day06: Lantern fishes

I followed the steps described in the puzzle and easily got the first star.

I thought this might be good enough for the second star.
I was wrong: it takes up just too much memory.
I even tried to optimize it and run it fish by fish, but it still took too long.

Take a look at the solution by @uniqueck - it is quite elegant!
And fast!
