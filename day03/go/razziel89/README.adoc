== Day 03: Binary Diagnostic ==

This is my implementation for the second round of the binary diagnostic puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where all helper functions that
might be re-used later on reside.
There is also a `set.go`, which contains specifications of a string set that
also knows how often individual entries have been added to it.

`solution.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::solution.go[tags=solution]
----

`utils.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::utils.go[tags=utils]
----

`set.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::set.go[tags=set]
----

There are currently no tests.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution.
