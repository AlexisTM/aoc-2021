=== First Star

How does it work: +

I created a class function reading file input and separating coordinates. Then for each horizontal and vertical lines a map entry is created with value 1 or if already existing, increased by one. The function returns the number of all map entries higher than one. The function has one parameter which is by default 0, that means the evaluation of diagonal lines will be skipped.

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

By invokeing the function with a parameter higher than 0 the diagonal lines will also be taken into account.
