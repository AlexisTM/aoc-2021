== Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture

Today I wanted to do another TDD vs hacky comparison.
This time doing TDD (and initial thinking) first and then later see how fast I can hack it knowing the way forward.

=== TIL

. underestimated how big this puzzles get...again
. when tracking objects try to create a map that can be indexed easily rather than relying on searching items in a list with every iteration
. `== 2` is not the same as `>= 2`

=== First Star

At first I was focused only on the example and led astray by its small numbers - as it happens every year.
