== AoC21-05: Hydrothermal Venture
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5

=== Info

Avoid hydrothermal ventline clouds
*: Find hot-spots on grid with >1 lines crossing, consider only vertical & horizontal lines
**: Find hot-spots including diagonal lines (45Â° only)
Return number of hot-spots on 1000x1000 grid

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and prepocessed --> list of list with two coordinates (set of x,y).
*: check if horizontal or vertical, then add +1 to grid. Increase hot-spot count when grid point equals 2.
**: add second loop to additionally process horizontal lines and increase count accordingly.

=== Learned today

Quite straightforward, just a few small traps wrt. processing order of hor/vert lines vs. diagonal lines
