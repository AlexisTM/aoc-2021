== Day 01: Sonar Sweep ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1[AoC|2021|01].

=== Part 1 ===
Parse the input

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]
----

And count how often consecutive inputs increase (test is part of documentation)

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=count_increase]
----

=== Part 2 ===

Create sliding sums over three consecutive numbers (again with test as part of documentation)

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=sliding_sums]
----

and use function ``count_increase`` from part 1 again

=== Today I learned ===

The ``zip`` function on iterators is useful.
