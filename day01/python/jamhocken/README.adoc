== What I learned

. I forgot that Python also can do string comparisons. Now, I remember.

== Approach

. For star 1, I just go through the whole list comparing the values pair-wise.
. For star 2, I created a list with the 3 value window. And then compared that list pair-wise.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
