== Day 01: Sonar Sweep ==

This is my implementation for the sonar sweep puzzle.
It is implemented in Golang.
I will try to start out developing in a modular way, hoping to re-use much of
one implementation for the next one.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where all helper functions that
might be re-used later on reside.
It will likely be split into several modules over the course of this year's AOC.

[source,go,numbered]
----
include::solutio.go[tags=main]
----

[source,go,numbered]
----
include::utils.go[tags=utils]
----

There are currently no tests.
I will add them as needed to simplify debugging for more complex puzzles.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution.
