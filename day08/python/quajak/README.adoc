Advent of Code 2021

== Python

First store all digits with the same length in a dictionary. 

For the first star for each word in the 4 letter output, check if only one possible digit has that length.

For the second star, first normalize all words by sorting the characters alphabetically. 

Then solve the simple ones (where only one integer needs that many digits).

To solve the three cases with six digits, if the case includes all values of 4, its a 9, else if it contains all values of 1, its a 0, else its a 6.

To solve the cases with five cases, if it contains the 1, its a 3, if the entire letter is contained within the 9, its a 5, else its a 2. 

Then convert each output into a integer and sum all outputs.
