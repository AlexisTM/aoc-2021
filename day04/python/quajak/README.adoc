Advent of Code 2021

== Python

Define a class to track all non-drawn values on the board and all possible lines in a board and how many of the values in each have not been drawn. 
Then whenever a value is drawn decrement all counters if value is in the line and remove the value from the not-drawn list. 
For the first star, simply print when the first counter reaches 0, sum up the non-drawn values and multiply by the current value.

For the second star, modify the board to keep track of if the board has already been solved and draw until all boards have been finished.
