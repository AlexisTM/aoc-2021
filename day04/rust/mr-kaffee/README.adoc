== Day 04: Giant Squid ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4[AoC|2021|04].

So let's play Bingo (I don't remember when I last did...)

=== Part 1 & 2 ===

After I solved part 1 today, there was very little to add for part 2. Hence, there is only one solution for both parts.

I created a ```struct``` for a bingo board with a function ```new``` to create new boards, ```apply_draws``` to apply draws until a row or a column is complete, and a function ```get_score``` to calculate the final score:

include::src/lib.rs[tags=board]
----

Then, I created a function which parses the input to a vector of boards and a vector of numbers drawn

include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]

Next, we are ready to play bingo. I play all the boards one by one and then look for the one which wins first and the one which wins last and return their scores

=== Tests ===

I kind of did TDD ;)
