== Day 00: Hello World ==

I am still undecided what language to use this year.
I'll start with https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust].

=== General structure ===

Generally, my solutions will contain a `src/main.rs` file which reads inputs, calls the solution functions and measures time

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/main.rs[tags=read_input]
----

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/main.rs[tags=main]
----

The actual solution will be implemented in a `lib.rs` file

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=function]
----

The `lib.rs` file also contains the tests in a separate submodule.
I will use this for test-driven development, e.g., based on the examples given in the puzzles.

----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=tests]
----

=== Run Solutions ===

Run solution with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to see the effect of compiler optimization)

Run tests with `cargo test`
