== Day 00: Getting started  ==

As in the past years I will get more into kotlin. Here in gitpod solutions will run with kotlin script.

For execution enter _kotlin day2100.kts_ in the command line.

Read the input file is done via a function call:

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2100.kts[tags=read_input]
....

Output is printed in main:app-name: 

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2100.kts[tags=output]
....
