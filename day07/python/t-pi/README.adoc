== AoC21-07: The Treachery of Whales
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7

=== Info

Align crab subs horizontally at single position with minimum fuel to escape the whale.
* Star1 (*): Linear fuel consumption with distance
* Star2 (**): Fuel consumption increases linearly with distance (1:1 + 2:2 + 3:3 + ...)

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line (one long line today...) and prepocessed.
* Two functions: 
 * First star to calculate the sum of the differences
 * Second star to calculate the sum of the sums of (difference range + 1), to account for increasing fuel need

=== Learned today

Basic algebra: had to recheck the formula to sum first n integers :)
