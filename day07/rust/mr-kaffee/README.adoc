Parse input into number of vectors

Create a function that calculates the fuel need for a given alignment position (after refactoring for part 2, this contains a cost function to map distance to cost as argument, for part 1, this is just the identity)

=== Part 2 ===

For part two I just use a different cost function: ``COST_LINEAR`` solves part 1, ``COST_INCREASING`` solves part 2:
