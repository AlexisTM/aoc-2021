== Day 10: Syntax Scoring ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10[AoC|2021|10].

=== Part 1 ===

Solution idea is to parse the characters one by one. If they are open delimiters, push the corresponding closing delimiter to a queue. If they are closing delimites, pop values from the queue and compare them to current character.

If a comparison fails, an illegal character is found and its score is returned. Then the sum over the scores is taken.

=== Part 2 ===

Same idea as for part 1. Now discard lines where comparisons fail. What remains in the queue once a line is processed are the characters required to repair the line. This time, I push/pop at the front, so that I can iterate over the remaining queue from first to last character.
